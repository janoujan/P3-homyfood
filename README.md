 ### Liven up a web page with CSS animations

## languages and tools

#### HTML5 / CSS3 / Sass (SCSS)

## Scenario and requirements

You have just been recruited at Ohmyfood!, as a junior developer.

Ohmyfood! is a young startup that would like to impose itself on the catering market. The goal is to develop a 100% mobile site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to traditional reservation systems, customers will be able to compose their meal menu so that the dishes are ready when they arrive. No more waiting times at the restaurant!  

You are one of the 4 lucky ones who have the chance to work on this beautiful project.  

The team consists of:  
     Paul, the CTO of the future site;  
     Fanny, the UX designer recruited to put the site in the colors of Paris;  
     Anissa, commercial in charge of canvassing restaurants;  
         and you, responsible for the development of the site.  

Anissa is in full canvassing for this project, with restaurateurs. She calls out to you at the coffee machine:  

Don't you know the news? Do you remember the sales manager of your favorite restaurant? I managed to convince him, with 3 others, to deposit their cards online! I will send you the file with the 4 menus in the afternoon. Your turn now !  

You then decide, with the team, that the site will initially contain 4 menus. Here is the brief you establish with the CTO, Paul.  

Back at your office, you find an email from Fanny who sends you the models of the site.  

For this project, you version all your code on Github with regular commits to follow its progress and publish the site online more easily.
